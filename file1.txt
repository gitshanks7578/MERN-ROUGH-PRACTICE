this is file 1 for understanding git

add content to file 1

    git status -> tells what files are staged,left to be staged etc ....made changes but havent been added
    git add . -> adds all files
    git add file1.txt file2.txt ->multiple files

    -------takes us to staging area

    git commmit -m "message"

    --------commits


BRANCHING AND CONFLICTS
    git branch -> gives list of branches
    git branch "name" -> makes a new branch 

    git switch "name" -> switches to that branch

HOW BRANCHING WORKS
    say u have main branch with all your code
    then u made a new branch named TEST1 
    then u created a file2.txt and pushed it

    now your TEST1 branch will have all the code from before + TEST2.txt
    
    so basically each branch inherits all its content from parent and the new content being pushed gets added to the branch
    
    when u switch back to main u wont find those changes
